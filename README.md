## Project Description
This project analyzes large-scale road accident datasets to uncover patterns and factors influencing accident severity and frequency. Via dynamic dashboards, it empowers stakeholders to monitor trends and prioritize resources effectively.

## Tools & Technologies
- Excel: Data cleaning, transformation, and preliminary analysis
- SQL: Data extraction and querying from databases
- Power BI & Tableau: Interactive dashboard and data visualization creation

## Data Sources
- Road accident datasets including accident details, severity, weather, vehicle type, and location attributes.

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Data Collection & Extraction**
   - Gather raw accident data from available sources.
   - Use SQL queries to extract relevant subsets for analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Perform data cleaning using Excel: handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries.
   - Create new features/columns (e.g., Year, Month).

3. **Data Analysis**
   - Use Excel pivot tables for preliminary insights.
   - Perform SQL aggregations for summaries.

4. **Dashboard Development**
   - Develop visuals for key metrics: severity distribution, temporal trends, geographical hotspots.
   - Design interactive elements like slicers/filters for user-driven exploration.
   - Utilize Power BI and Tableau for rich data visualization.

5. **Insights & Interpretation**
   - Identify high-risk conditions, temporal patterns, and spatial clusters.
   - Provide recommendations to stakeholders based on data.

## Key Insights
- Accident severity mostly slight but serious/fatal remain critical.
- Weather and lighting conditions influence accident likelihood.
- Temporal trends show recurring peak periods.
- Geographic hotspots identified for targeted intervention.

## How to Use the Dashboard
- Select filters to explore accident data by time, location, or conditions.
- Analyze KPIs and charts for quick decision-making.
- Export reports for further review.

## Future Enhancements
- Automate data updates with live database connections.
- Integrate more granular vehicle and driver behavior data.
- Incorporate predictive analytics for risk forecasting.
